title: experiment in scalable js
---

it's been almost a year since [Eric Shepherd](http://twitter.com/arkitrave) presented an approach to building sustainable, well organized JavaScript at BK.js with [Building a JavaScript Module Framework at Gilt](http://www.meetup.com/Brooklyn-Javascript/events/16502694/).

I've had an opportunity to start introducing these ideas in a new project, 
here's [an experiment using our first iteration](/examples/lc/).

beyond Eric's presentation, other material has been helpful.

 * Scalable Javascript Application Architecture, [Nicholas Zakas](http://twitter.com/slicknet).<br /> [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXjVFPosQHw), [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/nzakas/scalable-javascript-application-architecture)

 * [Scalable JavaScript Design Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/scalablejs/) and
[Patterns For Large-Scale JavaScript Application Architecture](http://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/), [Addy Osmani](http://twitter.com/addyosmani).

 * tuts+ tutorial on [Writing Modular JavaScript](http://tutsplus.com/tutorial/writing-modular-javascript/) by [Andrew Burgess](http://twitter.com/andrew8088).
